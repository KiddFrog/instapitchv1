As a user I want to be able to play the videos for my onboarding. Once I've completed the videos, I want to collapse them out of view by hitting the completed button. If I need to refrence them in the future, I'll click on the welcome video or product video text in the nav bar.

As a user I want to quickly refrence the tools for this company by clicking on the buttons. For each button I click on I want the templates to show up for email, linkedin, sms, cold call, demo and recorded calls.*bonus* recorded calls should links to audio clips.

As a user I want the contact database section to populate contact information for one account at a time from the contact database. I would like to have their name email phone number and social links.

As a user I want to update the account with logged notes for my interactions. I want to have 2 inputs, a text section for a description of the call and a drop down option to update the stage of an account. The stages should be Prospecting, Appt Set, Pitched, Free Trial, and Signed Up

*bonus* I would like to add a button under the recent activity table/form. This button would display the next contact in the database. This will allow the sales person to move through the client list. It should also populate all of that clients historical logged activity.
